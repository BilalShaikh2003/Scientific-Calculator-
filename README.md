# Scientific-Calculator-
I created a scientific calculator inspired by the Casio fx-911CW using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With AI assistance, I added functions like sin, cos, log, DEG/RAD/GRAD modes, and keyboard input. The project improved my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and math logic.
